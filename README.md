# ProgpJS v2

## Introduction

### What is ProgpJS?

ProgpJS is a fast javascript engine for the Go language, using V8 as backend.

ProgpJS is "fast and fast": fast to execute and fast to develop with, thanks to a code generator handling
the technical stuffs for you. You write a simple Go function, say under what name it must be exposed to javascript
and it's all!

Benchmarks show that it's way faster than Node.js and on par with BunJS and DenoJS. But what is great with ProgpJS
isn't only his speed, but his capacity to easily mix Go code, C++ code and Javascript code, while been very simple to use.
With ProgpJS there isn't technical complexity, nothing, ProgpJS takes in charge all the difficulties for you!

ProgpJS comes with a Node.js compatibility layer for projects needing it. It's in the first stage, but it can be
useful for those needing it. The goal of ProgpJS isn't to be compatible with Node.js, mainly because ProgpJS goal
is to make interact javascript and Go, it's not a Node.js replacement. With Node.js your project is 100% javascript
while with ProgpJS you code your tools in Go (for his high speed) and you use your components through javascript.
